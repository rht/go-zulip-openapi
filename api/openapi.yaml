        This API endpoint is used by clients such as the Zulip mobile and
        terminal apps to implement password-based authentication.  Given the
        user's Zulip login credentials, it returns a Zulip API key that the client
        can use to make requests requests as the user.

        This endpoint is only useful for Zulip servers/organizations with
        EmailAuthBackend or LDAPAuthBackend enabled.

        The Zulip mobile apps also support SSO/social authentication (GitHub
        auth, Google auth, SAML, etc.) that does not use this endpoint.  Instead,
        the mobile apps reuse the web login flow passing the `mobile_flow_otp` in
        a webview, and the credentials are returned to the app (encrypted) via a redirect
        to a `zulip://` URL.

        !!! warn ""
            **Note:** If you signed up using passwordless authentication and
            never had a password, you can [reset your password](/help/change-your-password).

            See the [API keys](/api/api-keys) documentation for
            more details on how to download API key manually.

        see also [the unauthenticated variant](/api/dev-fetch-api-key).

        For easy testing of mobile apps and other clients and against Zulip
        development servers, we support fetching a Zulip API key for any user
        on the development server without authentication (so that they can
        implement analogues of the one-click login process available for Zulip
        development servers on the web).

        **Note:** This endpoint is only available on Zulip development
        servers; for obvious security reasons it will always return an error
        in a Zulip production server.

                            Event sent to all users in an organization when a user comes
                            back online after being long offline.  While most presence updates happen
                            done via polling the main presence endpoint, this event is important
                            to avoid confusing users when someone comes online and then immediately sends
                            a message (one wouldn't want them to still appear offline at that point!).

                                The short description of the stream rendered as HTML, intended to
                                be used when displaying the stream description in a UI.

                                One should use the standard Zulip rendered_markdown CSS when
                                displaying this content so that emoji, LaTeX, and other syntax
                                work correctly.  And any client-side security logic for
                                user-generated message content should be applied when displaying
                                this HTML as though it were the body of a Zulip message.

                                Whether the history of the stream is public to its subscribers.

                                Currently always true for public streams (i.e. invite_only=False implies
                                history_public_to_subscribers=True), but clients should not make that
                                assumption, as we may change that behavior in the future.

        Fetch message history from a Zulip server.

        `GET {{ api_url }}/v1/messages`

        This `GET /api/v1/messages` endpoint is the primary way to fetch
        message history from a Zulip server.  It is useful both for Zulip
        clients (e.g. the web, desktop, mobile, and terminal clients) as well
        as bots, API clients, backup scripts, etc.

        By specifying a [narrow filter](/api/construct-narrow), you can use
        this endpoint to fetch the messages matching any search query that is
        supported by Zulip's powerful full-text search backend.

        When a narrow is not specified, it can be used to fetch a user's
        message history. (We recommend paginating to 1000 messages at a time.)

        In either case, you specify an `anchor` message (or ask the server to
        calculate the first unread message for you and use that as the
        anchor), as well as a number of messages before and after the anchor
        message.  The server returns those messages, sorted by message ID, as
        well as some metadata that makes it easy for a client to determine
        whether there are more messages matching the query that were not
        returned due to the `num_before` and `num_after` limits.

        We recommend using `num_before <= 1000` and `num_after <= 1000` to
        avoid generating very large HTTP responses. A maximum of 5000 messages
        can be obtained per request; attempting to exceed this will result in an
        error.
      operationId: get_messages
      parameters:
      - description: |
          Integer message ID to anchor fetching of new messages. Supports special
          string values for when the client wants the server to compute the anchor
          to use:

          * `newest`: The most recent message.
          * `oldest`: The oldest message.
          * `first_unread`: The oldest unread message matching the
            query, if any; otherwise, the most recent message.

          The special values of `'newest'` and `'oldest'` are also supported
          for anchoring the query at the most recent or oldest messages.

          **Changes**: String values are new in Zulip 3.0 (feature level 1).  The
            `first_unread` functionality was supported in Zulip 2.1.x
            and older by not sending anchor and using use_first_unread_anchor.

            In Zulip 2.1.x and older, `oldest` can be emulated with
            `anchor=0`, and `newest` with `anchor=10000000000000000`
            (that specific large value works around a bug in Zulip
            2.1.x and older in the `found_newest` return value).

          if there is a Zulip avatar, and will be `null` for users who
          are using gravatar as their avatar.  This option
          significantly reduces the compressed size of user data,
          since gravatar URLs are long, random strings and thus do not
          compress well. The `client_gravatar` field is set to `true` if
          clients can compute their own gravatars.

        Send a stream or a private message.

        `POST {{ api_url }}/v1/messages`
      operationId: send_message
      parameters:
      - description: |
          The type of message to be sent. `private` for a private message and
          `stream` for a stream message.
        example: private
        explode: true
        in: query
        name: type
        required: true
        schema:
          enum:
          - private
          - stream
          type: string
        style: form
      - content:
          application/json:
            example:
            - 9
            - 10
            schema:
              items:
                type: integer
              type: array
        description: |
          For stream messages, either the name or integer ID of the stream. For
          private messages, either a list containing integer user IDs or a list
          containing string email addresses.

          **Changes**: Support for using user/stream IDs was added in Zulip 2.0.0.
        explode: true
        in: query
        name: to
        required: true
        style: form
      - description: |
          The content of the message. Maximum message size of 10000 bytes.
        example: Hello
        explode: true
        in: query
        name: content
        required: true
        schema:
          type: string
        style: form
      - description: |
          The topic of the message. Only required for stream messages
          (`type="stream"`), ignored otherwise.

          Maximum length of 60 characters.

          **Changes**: New in Zulip 2.0.  Previous Zulip releases encoded
          this as `subject`, which is currently a deprecated alias.
        example: Castle
        explode: true
        in: query
        name: topic
        required: false
        schema:
          type: string

      - description: |
          For clients supporting
          [local echo](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/subsystems/sending-messages.html#local-echo),
          the [event queue](/api/register-queue)
          ID for the client.  If passed, `local_id` is required.  If the message is
          successfully sent, the server will include `local_id` in the `message` event
          that the client with this `queue_id` will receive notifying it of the new message
          via [`GET /events`](/api/get-events).  This lets the client know unambiguously
          that it should replace the locally echoed message, rather than adding this new
          message (which would be correct if the user had sent the new message from another
          device).
        example: 1593114627:0
        explode: true
        in: query
        name: queue_id
        required: false
        schema:
          type: string
        style: form
      - description: |
          For clients supporting local echo, a unique string-format identifier
          chosen freely by the client; the server will pass it back to the client without
          inspecting it, as described in the `queue_id` description.
        example: "100.01"
        explode: true
        in: query
        name: local_id
        required: false

          For most API clients, you won't need this, but it's important
          for Zulip apps to handle rare corner cases when
          adding/removing votes on an emoji reaction added previously by
          another user.

          If the existing reaction was added when the Zulip server was
          using a previous version of the emoji data mapping between
          Unicode codepoints and human-readable names, sending the
          `emoji_code` in the data for the original reaction allows the
          Zulip server to correctly interpret your upvote as an upvote
          rather than a reaction with a "diffenent" emoji.
        example: 1f419
        explode: true
        in: query

          If an app is adding/removing a vote on an existing reaction,
          it should pass this parameter using the value the server provided
          for the existing reaction for specificity.  Supported values:

          * `unicode_emoji`: Unicode emoji (`emoji_code` will be its Unicode codepoint).

      description: |
        Check whether a set of messages match a [narrow](/api/construct-narrow).

        `GET {{ api_url }}/v1/messages/matches_narrow`

        For many common narrows (E.g. a topic), clients can write an
        efficient client-side check to determine whether a
        newly arrived message belongs in the view.

        This endpoint is designed to allow clients to handle more complex narrows
        for which the client does not (or in the case of full-text search,
        cannot) implement this check.

        The format of the `match_subject` and `match_content` objects is designed to match
        those of `GET /messages`, so that a client can splice these fields into a
        `message` object received from `GET /events` and end up with an extended message
        object identical to how a `GET /messages` for the current narrow would have
        returned the message.

          significantly reduces the compressed size of user data,

  /users/{email}/presence:
    get:
      description: |
        Get the presence status for a specific user.

        This endpoint is most useful for embedding data about a user's
        presence status in other sites (E.g. an employee directory).  Full
        Zulip clients like mobile/desktop apps will want to use the main
        presence endpoint, which returns data for all active users in the
        organization, instead.

        `GET {{ api_url }}/v1/users/{email}/presence`

        See
        [Zulip's developer documentation](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/subsystems/presence.html)
        for details on the data model for presence in Zulip.

                        **Deprecated**.  We plan to remove this in favor of recommending
                        using `GET /messages` with `anchor="newest"`.

                        The user's real email address.  This field is present only if

                                  *`color`: The hex value of the user's personal display color for the stream.

                                  *`is_muted`: Whether the stream is [muted](/help/mute-a-stream).

                                  **Changes**: Prior to Zulip 2.1, this feature was
                                  represented by the more confusingly named `in_home_view` (with the
                                  opposite value, `in_home_view=!is_muted`); for
                                  backwards-compatibility, modern Zulip still accepts that value.

                                  *`pin_to_top`: Whether to pin the stream at the top of the stream list.

                                  *`desktop_notifications`: Whether to show desktop notifications for all
                                  messages sent to the stream.

                                  *`audible_notifications`: Whether to play a sound notification for all
                                  messages sent to the stream.

                                  *`push_notifications`: Whether to trigger a mobile push notification for
                                  all messages sent to the stream.

                                  *`email_notifications`: Whether to trigger an email notification for all
                                  messages sent to the stream.

                                  *`in_home_view`: Whether to mute the stream (legacy property)

                                  *`wildcard_mentions_notify`: whether wildcard mentions trigger notifications
                                  as though they were personal mentions in this stream.

                                  A null value means the value of this setting

          If you do not specify this parameter, you will receive all

          your client in your client code.  For most applications, one

          Dictionary containing details on features the client supports that are

          * `notification_settings_null`: Boolean for whether the
            client can handle the current API with null values for
            stream-level notification settings (which means the stream
            is not customized and should inherit the user's global
            notification settings for stream messages).  New in Zulip
            2.1.0; in earlier Zulip releases, stream-level
            notification settings were simple booleans.

          * `bulk_message_deletion`: Boolean for whether the client's
             handler for the `delete_message` event type has been
             updated to process the new bulk format (with a
             `message_ids`, rather than a singleton `message_id`).
             Otherwise, the server will send `delete_message` events
             in a loop.  New in Zulip 3.0 (feature level 13).  This
             capability is for backwards-compatibility; it will be
             required in a future server release.

          * `user_avatar_url_field_optional`: Boolean for whether the
             client required avatar URLs for all users, or supports
             using `GET /avatar/{user_id}` to access user avatars.  If the
             client has this capability, the server may skip sending a
             `avatar_url` field in the `realm_user` at its sole discretion
             to optimize network performance.  This is an important optimization
             in organizations with 10,000s of users.
             New in Zulip 3.0 (feature level 18).

                        interpreted that as "the 1000 most recent private messages the user received".

        * If this is a Zulip server, and if so, what version of Zulip it's running.
        * What a Zulip client (e.g. a mobile app or
        [zulip-terminal](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-terminal/)) needs to
        know in order to display a login prompt for the server (e.g. what
        authentication methods are available).

        Notify other users whether the current user is typing a message.

        `POST {{ api_url }}/v1/typing`

        Clients implementing Zulip's typing notifications protocol should work as follows:

        * Send a request to this endpoint with `op="start"` when a user starts typing
          a private message or group private message, and also every
          `TYPING_STARTED_WAIT_PERIOD=10` seconds that the user continues to actively type
          or otherwise interact with the compose UI (E.g. interacting with the compose box
          emoji picker).
        * Send a request to this endpoint with `op="stop"` when a user pauses using the
          compose UI for at least `TYPING_STOPPED_WAIT_PERIOD=5` seconds or cancels
          the compose action (if it had previously sent a "start" operation for that
          compose action).
        * Start displaying "Sender is typing" for a given conversation when the client
          receives an `op="start"` event from the [events API](/api/get-events).
        * Continue displaying "Sender is typing" until they receive an `op="stop"` event
          from the [events API](/api/get-events) or `TYPING_STARTED_EXPIRY_PERIOD=15`
          seconds have passed without a new `op="start"` event for that conversation.

        This protocol is designed to allow the server-side typing notifications implementation
        to be stateless while being resilient; network failures cannot result in a user being
        incorrectly displayed as perpetually typing.

        See
        [the typing notification docs](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/subsystems/typing-indicators.html)
        for additional design details on Zulip's typing notifications protocol.

          list of email addresses.  Support for the email address-based format was
          removed in Zulip 3.0 (feature level 11).

        If you do not specify this parameter, you will receive all

    ReactionType:
      description: |
        If an app is adding/removing a vote on an existing reaction,
        it should pass this parameter using the value the server provided
        for the existing reaction for specificity.  Supported values:

        * `unicode_emoji`: Unicode emoji (`emoji_code` will be its Unicode codepoint).
        * `realm_emoji`: Custom emoji. (`emoji_code` will be its ID).
        * `zulip_extra_emoji`: Special emoji included with Zulip.  Exists to
           namespace the `zulip` emoji.

        **Changes**: In Zulip 3.0 (feature level 2), this become
        optional for [custom emoji](/help/add-custom-emoji);
        previously, this endpoint assumed `unicode_emoji` if this
        parameter was not specified.
      example: unicode_emoji
      explode: true

    EmojiCode:
      description: |
        A unique identifier, defining the specific emoji codepoint requested,
        within the namespace of the `reaction_type`.

        For most API clients, you won't need this, but it's important
        for Zulip apps to handle rare corner cases when
        adding/removing votes on an emoji reaction added previously by
        another user.

        If the existing reaction was added when the Zulip server was
        using a previous version of the emoji data mapping between
        Unicode codepoints and human-readable names, sending the
        `emoji_code` in the data for the original reaction allows the
        Zulip server to correctly interpret your upvote as an upvote
        rather than a reaction with a "diffenent" emoji.

      explode: true
