## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**AvatarUrl** | Pointer to **string** | The URL of the user&#39;s avatar.  Can be null only if client_gravatar was passed, which means that the user has not uploaded an avatar in Zulip, and the client should compute the gravatar URL by hashing the user&#39;s email address itself for this user.  | [optional] 
**Client** | **string** | A Zulip \&quot;client\&quot; string, describing what Zulip client sent the message.  | [optional] 
**Content** | **string** | The content/body of the message.  | [optional] 
**RenderedContent** | **string** | The content/body of the message rendered in HTML.  | [optional] 
**ContentType** | **string** | The HTTP &#x60;content_type&#x60; for the message content.  This will be &#x60;text/html&#x60; or &#x60;text/x-markdown&#x60;, depending on whether &#x60;apply_markdown&#x60; was set.  | [optional]

**SenderShortName** | **string** | Reserved for future use.  | [optional] 
**StreamId** | **int32** | Only present for stream messages; the ID of the stream.  | [optional] 
**Subject** | **string** | The &#x60;topic&#x60; of the message (only present for stream messages).  The field name is a legacy holdover from when topics were called \&quot;subjects\&quot; and will eventually change.  | [optional] 
**TopicLinks** | **[]string** | Data on any links to be included in the &#x60;topic&#x60; line (these are generated by [custom linkification filters][linkification-filters] that match content in the message&#39;s topic.)  **Changes**: New in Zulip 3.0 (feature level 1). Previously, this field was called &#x60;subject_links&#x60;; clients are recommended to rename &#x60;subject_links&#x60; to &#x60;topic_links&#x60; if present for compatibility with older Zulip servers.  | [optional]
